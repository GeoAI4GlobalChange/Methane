The original eddy covariance methane flux datasets are from FLUXNET-CH4, available at https://fluxnet.org/data/fluxnet-ch4-community-product/.  
The chamber datasets are from the BAWLD-CH4 dataset (https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-5151-2021) 
and the dataset in Baoâ€™s study (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c01616).    
For the input drivers, GPP was obtained from the GOSIF dataset, which is available at https://globalecology.unh.edu/data/GOSIF-GPP.html.  
Other variables (soil temperature, air temperature, air pressure, precipitation, wind speed, snow cover, and soil water content) were obtained from ERA5-land datasets,  
which are available at (https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5).  
Please read the corresponding paper for other datasets used for uncertainty analysis.
